#Preface
This is going to be my latest blogging attempt. I had stopped maintaining the blog for last couple of years. 
I like to discuss tech, js. Hope this blog provides me platform for the same.


## Why ?
It gives a way to express my thoughts, opinions over situations. 
It gives me a break from continous flow of thoughts related to work. Provides an oppertunity to step back and retrospect things happening arround me. 
As 2019 turned, I got an oppertunity to start something new as a new year resolution. 
Speaking of resolutions there are some more,
* Follow 9 to 5 work hours 
* Exercise minimum 4 days a week 

## What? 
I will be blogging about anything and everything that I experience in my work-n-life. 
I am planning to post a blog every week 

## How
I am using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), to create a blog.
