## Met the goals? ... Yes, partially!!
- [x] Exercised for 5 days  :yellow_heart:
- [x] Fixed blog so that I could post this one :wink:
- [x] Followed 9 to 5 work hours. Umm not perfectly, though happy with outcome.
- [ ] Write weekly post. :neutral_face:

## What next?
Be persistant with the course of actions. 
Also I am thinking of one good product idea will write about it next week. I want to tick the last one too :wink:.
I am still in two minds about enabling comments, should I add it to blog or keept it to twitter. Will decide soon.
